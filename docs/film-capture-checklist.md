# Historical v3 film capture checklist

**Status:** This checklist records the earlier Harmonise v3 fixture-only film, not a v5 release. The v3 MP4 is **173.500 seconds (2:53.5)**, 1920×1080 H.264, and silent, with burned-in narration text and an SRT sidecar. It is not the final v5 film.

## Current v5 handoff status

The v5 UI work adds local frontend interactions for independent My Space, Communities, Connections, My Journey and Find Support surfaces; topic-separated conversation state; confirmable/correctable understanding; seeded group threads and stories; local group reply preview and consent; group-only connection states; optional contribution review; editable goal/reflection states; and example support and moderation screens. These have been checked with lint, typecheck, production build, 27 unit tests and 26 desktop/mobile Playwright checks.

The deployed application remains a static GitHub Pages export using local fictional fixtures. No Meta key, server backend/API, authentication, database, live community or messaging, real moderation service, provider directory, or provider-verification process is configured. No model evaluation or Meta inference was run. Local consent/reply/moderation screens do not publish content, route a report to a real reviewer, or enforce server-side role boundaries.

The v3 film remains historical: it is silent and does not show v5 independent spaces or reciprocal contribution, audible narration, actual Meta model evidence, or the technical proof required by the v5 brief. A final narrated v5 film has not been produced. Do not present v3 as a v5 product recording or evidence of Meta use.

## Current v5 screenshot evidence

The repository's [`evidence/v5/`](../evidence/v5/) inventory contains the current fixture-mode UI screenshots: `01-my-space.png`, `02-understanding-shift.png`, `03-relevance-comparison.png`, `04-community-thread.png`, `05-ravi-human-connection.png`, `06-reviewed-contribution.png`, `07-connections.png`, `08-moderation-review.png`, `09-provider-unavailable.png`, and `10-mobile-navigation.png`. These are frontend UI captures only. They are not Meta/API execution evidence or architecture diagrams and do not verify real communities, moderators, or providers.

## Capture and review

- [x] Captured the existing Next.js app in Chromium at 1920×1080 with a fresh browser context.
- [x] Used the actual composer to show a hesitant draft, revision, send, contextual selectable answer, further messages, and correction of a tentative interpretation.
- [x] Demonstrated recording permission, stop, transcript review/edit, and explicit send. The app clearly says transcription is not connected; the text was typed by the user in the review field.
- [x] Confirmed the user-selected family-pressure context and choice to explore human perspectives.
- [x] Rejected the broad legal-topic result and captured the changed discovery view. This context comparison and reranking are deterministic illustrative fixtures, not model output.
- [x] Opened the relevant fictional community and read contrasting fictional accounts from Nisha, Mira, and Ravi without joining.
- [x] Reviewed the exact recipient, `QuietRiver` alias, and question before explicit consent. The prepared response is labeled fictional and no message was sent.
- [x] Edited and kept a personal takeaway, chose a next step, and opened a later life chapter separately without carrying the relationship context.
- [x] Captured no outbound requests or browser page errors.
- [x] Reviewed the opening, discovery, share-preview, and closing frames at full 1920×1080 resolution.
- [x] Verified the final H.264 video with `ffprobe` and decoded the entire file with FFmpeg.

## Measured sequence

Times below are approximate film timestamps from the captured browser interaction events, including the two-second title card.

| Beat | Film time | Evidence shown |
|---|---:|---|
| Opening and hesitant draft | 0:00–0:14 | Harmonise title and fictional-participant credit, then Arjun revises an unsent thought in the conversation composer. |
| Conversation, voice review, and correction | 0:14–1:02 | Multiple user turns and example replies; voice recording and manual transcript review; Arjun says he does not want a relationship verdict. |
| Confirmed need and contextual discovery | 1:02–1:26 | Arjun confirms what he wants; rejects the broad legal topic and sees the family-pressure context result move forward. |
| Contrasting human perspectives | 1:26–1:50 | Nisha, Mira, and Ravi are explored as fictional, distinct lived-experience examples; Ravi's differences and unknowns remain visible. |
| Exact share and consent | 1:50–2:10 | Ravi's recipient, alias, and question are reviewed; consent is explicit; a prepared fictional response follows. |
| User-owned takeaway | 2:10–2:38 | Arjun edits and keeps a thought privately and chooses a next step. |
| New chapter and continuity | 2:38–2:53.5 | A new city chapter starts separately; the journey shows both chapters and the context boundary. |

- Duration: **173.500000 seconds**
- Capture source: two-second title card plus 1,715 Chromium frames sampled at 10 fps while actual browser controls drove the journey

The SRT text is burned into the MP4 and also provided as a sidecar. No synthetic narrator or voice actor was available; the separate script is ready for a narrator to record. All characters, community content, story rankings, responses, and questions are local fictional fixtures. No Meta model call, Muse transcription, actual human message, database write, live community activity, or moderation action occurred. Do not present this film as evidence of Meta inference.
